My question is, should I wait for a little bit of a pull back before entering? Also for somebody new to this, what would you put money into? SP500? Nasdaq? individual stocks?

Outperforming the Market—Time to Let It Ride or Rebalance?,"Hi all,

But now I’m wondering—should I leave it alone and ride the wave, or is it time to re-evaluate and diversify?

* How do you decide when to take profits versus letting winners run?
* Are there specific signs or market conditions you watch for before rebalancing?

I’d love to hear how others manage a situation like this. Stick with what’s working, or play it safe and re-diversify?

Why do people care that Citi bank downgraded to a sell? It’s literally a bank that could potentially have to rival NU soon if they break into USA markets. Citi bank is just worried about a rapidly growing, amazing company.

If anything, the downgrade should be seen as a good sign. It shows that american banks like Citi are starting to feel a bit of pressure from how fast NU has been able to expand its user base.

I know Brazil has made changes to its financial regulations. However, NU is rapidly expanding its user base to other countries. Plus, Brazils projected annual GDP growth per year is very good.

I have a buffer in checking I don't go below and a couple thousand in savings in case I need it, which I haven't. Investing is going great, and I'm only kicking myself for not doing it sooner.

What's you're overall gain on the stock? What about your choice are you most proud or most ashamed of? Would you advise investing in it today?

My most proud stock is $SQ, since it's my third highest gainer right now, and it was the first stock where I decided I should sell something I own to buy it. I sold my Disney stock to hold $SQ instead. I believe in cash app, and despite their recent move away from BTC investing, their part in the BTC business, as a place to safely purchase and move BTC to your own wallet reliably, or hold sats if you feel unsure of your own ability to secure your BTC, is highly profitable, moreso with every surge in price. I also thing their small business applications will improve over time, as any tech does. And being a big name early in the game will help in the long run. I also like Jack Dorsey because of his personal commitment to BTC and how he ran Twitter before Elon.

My most ashamed stock is realty income, $O, which despite all the rate cuts has gained less than 3% since I got it xP although has paid some dividends which I didn't reinvest because I didn't know how to yet. The big purchase it made relatively recently did not move the needle for me or apparently any of its other investors.

Thoughts on buying BRK.Binstead of S&P this month?,"
Does anyone have any thoughts on buying BRB.K this month as a one off instead of the usual DCA into S&P 500?

I usually allocate the same amount of money to S&P 500 every month and have done this for years. However given much the stock market is up (27% YTD), especially including the recent trump mania, I think we are due a pull back.

And the way Buffet has been selling stocks recently, so does he. However would spending the same amount this month on Berkshire Hathaway stock instead of S&P, as a one off, hedge against this risk. 

WB has the highest stock pile he’s ever had, whilst still in the market albeit much smaller. I was just thinking it as a way of further diversification - I’ll obviously keep all of my investments in the S&P but as a one off for this month was thinking it could be wise to load up on BH stock, so can receive the benefits of the business of interest from their cash holdings as well as their equity holdings. 

Do you guys think this is a reasonable thought process or just stick to the plan and keep DCAing into the S&P this month?

Thanks. ",19,25,"Does anyone have any thoughts on buying BRBK this month as a one off instead of the usual DCA into SP 500

Evaluating Solar/Wind Companies – Overwhelmed by KPIs,"I’m trying to evaluate a solar/wind company, and I’m finding it much more complicated than analyzing a “normal” tech or consumer company.

There are so many KPIs that I’m struggling to wrap my head around. For example, I’ve come across terms like Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) and MWh produced, but it doesn’t stop there. Other metrics I’ve seen include:
	•	Capacity Factor: How efficiently the company uses its installed capacity.
	•	Installed Capacity (MW): The total capacity of their assets.
	•	Project Pipeline: Upcoming projects in development and their stages.
	•	PPA Contracts: Details of Power Purchase Agreements, like duration and pricing.
	•	O&M Costs: Operations and Maintenance expenses per MWh.

It feels overwhelming compared to the more familiar revenue growth, margins, and user metrics in tech or consumer companies.

How do you prioritize which KPIs to focus on when evaluating companies in this sector? Are there specific ones that are more critical depending on whether they’re utility-scale, distributed energy, or equipment manufacturers?",4,6,"Im trying to evaluate a solarwind company and Im finding it much more complicated than analyzing a normal tech or consumer company

3 Months of Gains! Let's go!,"Almost 6 months ago, I mutually agreed to part ways with my company. I was President of a Construction Company that was private equity backed and based in Milwaukee. A fun opportunity, and different environment compared to being a serial entrepreneur. Had the opportunity to service hundreds of customers, and build a brand at the expense of someone else! Definitely a cool chapter of my life. Unfortunately, my old man was diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer on January 1, 2024 (Happy new year, I guess right?). He currently lives in India, and I split time between Milwaukee and Philadelphia. Without getting into the weeds, I resigned and relocated to India and travel back and forth every 3 months for a couple of weeks.

I decided over the summer, that I would begin full time trading. I have been passively investing in the market for the past 10 years, more active since the beginning of the pandemic. I have taught friends, made and then lost and then recovered and made again, I've been in and out of the market, but I decided to apply my approach at scale.

As an investor, I'm a believer in fundamentals, but also a big value investor. Being a serial entrepreneur and having scaled a variety of businesses in global markets, I have found that I have a deep understanding of valuation and value-prospects, I believe I have a similar approach and understanding to various MMs, and have used that approach intertwined with technical to read the market. My goal was to first generate enough monthly income to cover all liabilities I have on the books, approx. 7-8k per month in fixed expenses. I have multiple accounts where I trade options exclusively, but I decided I would set up a new account purely for trading of equities only.

I told my Old Man there were 251 trading days in a typical year, if I could average 1% per day, I would be able to generate 251% return. LOL... ambitious I know. I did a little math, looked at my trading history, and formulated a pricing strategy for entry and exit in various ticker symbols where I have done a lot of due diligence. It's funny...I found there are some names that I can never win on, and there are some names, that I can just continue to win with (all mental I know...) but I know the price levels realy well. Not every trade is a win, and you'll see that - but I use my losses as ticket symbols to attack on swing trades and recover my losses over the course of the upcoming year.

I created an account in Robinhood with $36,000 opening balance on September 3rd, 2024. I average about $13,000 in margin. I transfer any profits when I close a position and the equity balance is greater than $36,000.

Here are my results!

I completed the first 3 months, as of today, with a 92.26% return (Robinhood's percentages are all messed up because it's counts the withdrawals as capital reduction versus capital gains). I hope I can keep this up going forward! Wish me luck, regards.

"Assaults, Cover-ups, Ruined Reputation, and a 51% Stock Drop — Any Chance For Wynn Resorts?","So here is the full story of one of the biggest stock drops of WYNN (though they haven’t recovered till this day). Also, anyone here with $WYNN? What’s your thoughts about it?   


[**https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/11/42050388/high-stakes-and-higher-scandals-inside-wynn-resorts-legal-and-ethical-crisis**](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/11/42050388/high-stakes-and-higher-scandals-inside-wynn-resorts-legal-and-ethical-crisis)  


First things first: Steve Wynn, the company’s founder, was key to its brand and success, as they positioned it. But then, in January 2018, the Wall Street Journal revealed sexual misconduct allegations against him, backed by over 150 interviews.  
  
  
These allegations, some dating back decades, led to investigations by Nevada and Massachusetts regulators. Both found Wynn guilty and uncovered a cover-up by senior executives (what a shocker, right?). The result was a staggering $55M in fines for the company.  


After that, the market reaction was fast. $WYNN stock plunged 18% in just days, triggering a lawsuit from investors. They accused the company of hiding Wynn’s misconduct and exposing them to financial risk.  
  


Now, after years of legal battles, Wynn Resorts has agreed to pay a $70M settlement. So, if you owned shares during this time, you might be eligible to submit a claim.



While the company has taken steps to rebuild its reputation — like securing a UAE gaming license, reducing debt, and launching a $1B share buyback program — $WYNN still trades at $93, down 51% from its 2018 peak of $192.



And, has anyone here been affected by this? How much were your losses if so?",3,1,"So here is the full story of one of the biggest stock drops of WYNN though they havent recovered till this day Also anyone here with WYNN Whats your thoughts about it

I'm excited and nervous. as well with making the wrong chices, but I’m ready to give it a go and learn as much as I can along the way. Here’s where I’m at:

I’ve invested €400 into a Swedish index fund that focuses on the global tech sector yesterday. It’s been having quite a good 30% growth in the past six months. My plan is to hold onto it for six to nine months and see where it goes.

I’ve got €300 ready to put into individual stocks, and I want to make my first move by Friday (or next Monday). My goal is to find something with good short-term potential (around six months). I’d love to hear your tips on what to invest in and why!

* Which sectors are looking strong right now? Besides tech, are there industries that could really shine over the next six months?
* With now Trump returning to the presidency (or other big world events), which stocks or sectors might benefit?

How are smaller companies having such a bad 1-2 years lately but big companies are booming?,"How are smaller companies in good fields taking such a hit over the last 1-2 years but big companies continue to boom?

I’m no expert but that just seems crazy and so inorganic. I get that the company’s themselves aren’t doing well or might have a bad financial year but down 90% or more in a year or two just doesn’t really make sense to me. 

For it to drop like that, it obviously means people are selling but in order for those sales to go through that means people are still buying the stock so somebody still believes in the company. 

And like they could have a bad year where revenue is down 25% or more than previous years, so how does that justify a 90% drop? Or maybe they’re running low on cash, and really the only way to raise cash to help their situation is issuing shares, or a reverse split or whatever. If cash on hand is their biggest problem, wouldn’t making the stock price go up help the company and then lead to more growth? Granted cash-on-hand is probably hardly the biggest factors in these drops but just trying to grow my knowledge. 

I thought the stock market kinda went hand-in-hand in a sense that when big companies are growing, the little ones also follow, kinda like in 2020-2021, now it seems to be the opposite

I guess is that just the difference between big companies and small ones? When hard times come, the big ones are able to adjust and recover and the smaller ones just get destroyed?

And to finish it off, how do you tell the difference between companies that have no hope and will most likely be bankrupt soon, versus those that will most likely make a comeback and recover from being down 90% or more. I feel like it could be a great time to put a little bit of money in these smaller companies but don’t really know how to tell if they’re gonna last or not

Huge Insider Buying at Prospect Capital $PSEC,"Prospect capital's share price took a big hit last month and it was due to an audio forcing them to take a loss on investments that will bring in revenue soon. This dividend stock is way undervalued. And the insider buying lately backs up that thesis.

The CEO has purchased nearly 4.2 million shares or over $20 million! he takes 0 Salary! The President has a salary of 175K and has purchase about that in shares! Every day this week I get SEC filings saying they are buying more. See for yourself:

[https://www.prospectstreet.com/investors/Docs/InsiderFilings/](https://www.prospectstreet.com/investors/Docs/InsiderFilings/)

Yesterday somebody I follow took a call from the company and told us this:

""The Chief Credit Officer at PSEC called me about 11am yesterday. Steven Stone. I was surprised it was from a cell phone. We spoke in February for about 50 mins as well. I have actually met the CEO 3x, last about 13 years ago at an annual shareholders meeting. I first attended in my 20s, was in the city. 1 thing you should know about PSEC is that it is a super defensive stock. The idea is, it is supposed to stay level, about 6, and supposed to give you near 12% in dividends, while having a steady price… We can see that has happened in this market, but that is the idea. It is always good to diversify… I had called and thought the drop off was do to their main REIT business. That business has about 70 multi family properties. Some with 100s of units. Those properties are not prime areas, they are 2^(nd)/3^(rd) tier.. They cash flow well, but on paper, they can depreciate, the asset value, prime can depreciate a lot! So this quarter the value of the REITS were written down much harder than the past, this is determined by their auditor… Every quarter there 117 investments must be appraised…. The loss and bad quarter is on 3 companies. 1 of which they finally did take a write off of near 120 million! PGX a credit repair service. The original owners took out nearly 200 million loan. When they could no longer pay the loan back, as the Govt fined and halted the business, they could not pay it… So PSEC took it over. It has a lot of upside, the margins there are high. We had spoke about this in February and had hoped that the service would be up and running. But it is still shut down, so the auditor forced them to take the loss… This is on paper! They didn’t lose the cash, the cash was loaned out. Hence the EPS will look bad.. They did earn less income because the other 2 of 3 that messed this quarter up, are failing. PSEC suspended interest payments on these 2. 1 of these holds a 180 million loan. PSEC cut the dividend and has chosen to take over these 2 businesses for a turn around. When turned they may sell the business and reap rewards.. Personally, hearing about these other 2, EH! But the credit repair is a cash cow.""

Energy Fuels $UUUU DD,"**Overview**

Energy Fuels, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the extraction, recovery, recycling, exploration, permitting, evaluation, and sale of uranium mineral properties in the United States. The company produces and sells vanadium pentoxide, rare earth elements, and heavy mineral sands such as ilmenite, rutile, zircon, and monazite.

**Explanation of Element and Mineral Importance**

**Uranium –** This is the fuel for nuclear reactors. Please see my post on Uranium if you want to understand the significance of it, and why Energy Fuels will massively benefit from it. Link Here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g51fj0/get\_in\_on\_uranium\_now/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g51fj0/get_in_on_uranium_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

 

**Vanadium** is a key component in vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), which are used for energy storage systems. Due to shifts toward renewable energy sources, the demand for efficient, large-scale energy storage is increasing. VRFBs are particularly suited for grid storage due to their scalability, long lifespan, and ability to discharge over a long period, making vanadium an essential material for the emerging clean energy economy. This shift represents a significant growth driver for the vanadium market as energy storage technologies become increasingly vital.

https://preview.redd.it/8jf3r5ebv93e1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9db23e3e0e6bc655f2972abc967ae3283ac808e

**SWOT on VRFBs (Guidehouse Insights)**

The nuclear energy sector represents a significant opportunity for vanadium products. Vanadium alloys are highly valuable due to their low neutron-absorption characteristics and high temperature and corrosion resistance. These properties make vanadium-based alloys ideal for use in nuclear reactors, particularly in the construction of pressure vessels and structural components. The ability of vanadium alloys to withstand the harsh operating environments inside a nuclear reactor without significant degradation, extends the service life of these components, enhancing the overall safety and efficiency of nuclear power plants.

Vanadium is also used in the aerospace industry and plays a huge role in the steel industry as well, due to its ability to enhance the strength and durability of steel.

**Rare Earth Elements (REE’s)**

**NdPr –** A combination of two rare earth elements: Neodymium (Nd) and Praseodymium (Pr). These elements are both crucial in the production of high-strength permanent magnets. Their powerful magnetic properties are essential in: Electric vehicles, wind turbines, consumer electronics, and defense technologies. Energy Fuels is one of the few US companies able to commercialize the production of separated NdPr.

**NdFeB Magnet Content**

As we can see in the chart, NdPr accounts for about a third of NdFeB magnets composition.

**Heavy Mineral Sands**

**Ilmenite –** Mined and processed to produce titanium oxide (TiO2). TiO2 is used in paints, coatings, and plastics which allows UUUU to diversify their revenue further into industrial areas.

**Zircon –** Used for manufacturing ceramics, refractory materials, and foundry molds. Also used in the medical industry for things like dental and orthopedic implants, and for PET imaging which is used for cancer diagnostics.

**Rutile –** Similar to ilmenite, rutile has a superior quality of titanium content making it more valuable.

**Monazite –** A rare mineral that contains rare-earth elements and uranium. Used as a feedstock by Energy Fuels in their processing endeavors. NdPr is extracted from Monazite as well as the minerals mentioned above.

https://preview.redd.it/s4y482vev93e1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=29e6c68d972ac33b6d0b22506f6c5168fb1f924a

**White Mesa Mill**

·         100% owned by Energy Fuels, is the only facility in the USA able to process Monazite to produce REE’s.

·         The only fully licensed and operating conventional uranium mill in the US.

·         Completed “Phase 1” REE facility with up to 1,000 tonnes of separated NdPr production capacity.

·         Largest producer of Vanadium in the US. (Production on standby currently due to low prices, strong inventory on hand.

Average revenue growth for the last 3 years has been 196%.

The negative EBITDA is not something to worry about. Mining sites are not easy to develop and require a lot of funding. Although, once these mines are up and running, heavy mineral sands mining is low cost. They are continuing to focus on creating revenue generating assets. The company has essentially zero debt and very few liabilities, with assets that doubled from 2020 to 2023. In the next year, I believe we will see positive EBITDA due to mines becoming operational, instead of sitting idle.

**Acquisition of RadTran LLC**

On August 19^(th), 2024, Energy Fuels announced it acquired RadTran, a private company specializing in the separation of critical radioisotopes. Since 2021, Energy Fuels and RadTran have been working together to evaluate the feasibility of recovering radium-226 and radium-228 from uranium processing at White Mesa Mill. These recovered isotopes would be made available to the pharmaceutical industry and others to enable the production of acintium-225 and lead-212. These isotopes are critical components in the development of targeted alpha therapies which offer promising new treatments for various cancers. There is currently a global shortage of Ra-226 and Ra-228, therefore limiting the supply of Ac-225 and Pb-212. This is a huge acquisition for Energy Fuels as medical isotopes possess immense demand.

**Acquisition of Base Resources**

On October 2^(nd), 2024, Energy Fuels announced the completion of its acquisition of Base Resources. This is expected to transform the company into a global leader in critical mineral production, including titanium, zirconium, REEs, and uranium. This is huge for the company as they brought in world class management and operations capability while gaining ownership over the Toliara Project in Madagascar. This is widely considered by industry experts to be one of the best HMS (heavy mineral sands) projects in the world.

**Conclusion**

I think this is a company with massive potential to be a large player in the supply chain for Vanadium and REEs. With a stockpile of 905,000 pounds of V2O5, they are easily able to capitalize on growing demand. They are also in a great position to capitalize on the growing domestic market for uranium, as we continuously rely less on foreign nations. With 235,000 pounds of inventory on hand and a production capability of 1.1-1.4 million pounds of U3O8 per year, the company will be able to profit from further spot sales and long-term contracts. With strategic acquisitions of Base Resources and RadTran, the company clearly demonstrates commitment to growth and innovation. At a current price of **$6.90**, I believe within 2 years this company will triple in price to around **$20**.",11,5,"Overview

What's the logic behind .DJSOEP (Dow Jones U.S. Select Oil Exploration & Production Index)？,".DJSOEP reflects the performance of companies involved in oil and gas exploration and production. Its top 3 holdings are ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources, Inc. and Marathon Petroleum Corporation.

2, Oil mining output declines, Oil prices rise, oil companies' profits increase, company stock prices rise, and the index rises. The less oil mining, the higher this index is, explaining why it performs better under Biden administration.

Any idea/theories why TSM stock has been dropping this past month? it seemed to have dropped by 6.49% (on fidelity) this past month. Could the upcoming change in government administration be a strong enough reason for this change (and could it be permanent?) Is it still worth holding on to given its overall performance and influence? if so, when can we expect to see it start growing again?

Looking for some advice.

  
I am 44 years old and I have been casually saving over the past few years and had my money in a high-interest savings account that was getting 5.25% I saved up about 16k so far and I was hoping to make more than 50 dollars a month interest. I have moved the money out of the high-yield account, transferred it into my fidelity account, and bought into a mutual fund FCNTX. My ultimate goal is to double it over the next few years and use that money to buy a car. Should I leave it in the mutual fund or put it into an ETF?

2nd question, I have a 401k that I had with an old employer and have 150k total which is currently invested in 50% Fidelity 500 index (FXAIX) and 50% in Jp Morgan Large Cap Growth (JLGMX). Should I leave it where I have it? YTD performance is 24% and has done well over the past few years. Last year it was 30+ %. Again I have read a lot of people saying to invest in ETFs.

How many ETFs do you own?,"I'm seeing some people on reddit saying they own a ton of etfs, dozens and dozens, oftentimes many of them are across the same sector or at least have a lot of redundancies. Same thing for REITS; they'll have like 10 different REITs instead of just picking the one they think is best.  So I'm curious: how many different kinds of investmennt types (ETFs, mutual funds,  REITs, individual stocks) do you own? Do you just keep a small number of your favorites? Or do you own tons and tons? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach? If you feel comfortable sharing, provide your account total YTD return.

Opening an account other than 401k?,"

Hi everyone,

I started my career a few months ago and have been fortunate enough to have some expendable income. I’m currently contributing about $1,000 per month to my company’s 401k. My portfolio is allocated as follows: 60% in an S&P 500 index fund, 25% in a blue chip growth fund, and 15% in a 2065 target date fund. Originally, all my contributions were going to the 2065 fund, but I shifted to a more aggressive strategy since I'm only 23.

I'm considering opening another account to invest in individual stocks, as I'm somewhat limited in my current 401k options. I can afford an additional $500 per month for this. However, I'm also debating whether it would be better to just increase my 401k contributions, considering the tax advantages.

What do you all think? Should I diversify with individual stocks, or focus on maximizing my 401k?

Most Valuable Lessons I learned from stock market.,"1. DCA
2. Don’t pick shit stocks stick with the best names.
3. Don’t play options, ever.
4. Diversify. Everyone and their own way of doing this. Find which way works best for you.  
5. Don’t think about getting rich overnight, it takes years of DCA and scaling into a bigger portfolio and also where you will see best results(5-10+ years)
6. Always focus on maxing Roth IRA before brokerage. 
7. Why settle for the 2nd best when you can buy the best?(example; NVDA consistently outperformed AMD)
8. You should have less than 30(I have less than 10) stocks overall. You don’t want 300 stocks worth a few dollars, when you can have 10 or 30 worth a few thousand.

So I finally had the chance to login and unlocking Legend and although it is customizable (to an extent), it STILL lacks a variety of chart overlays and indicators.

Nope. Not even close.

You're only allowed 4 indicators total and 6 overlays. 6 overlays are a bit much, however, 4 indicators doesn't do it justice. For me, I like to have the following indicators giving me information: TTM, W/R, AROON, CCI, & EFI.

W/R doesn't exist on Legend, nor does TTM, W/E, or EFI... bummer.

Additionally, I only use Pivot Points & 4 SMAs (10, 20, 50, & 200).

Mrna looks a little undervalued ,"Was looking at MRNA heating up a lil bit off its low this year around 35.80. 1st winning week on decent volume too. Have to go back to about April of 2020 for these prices. But just in general it seems to be trading way off its averages. 

My thought is that the new administration won’t be as anti vax as medias make them out to be and MRNA will do just fine if not better if regulations open up. 

I don’t know much about their pipeline or approvals but looking at doing some 6 month call strikes and building the position on weak days for better price.

"An unusual problem: All the stocks I bought this year went instantly up, and I'm disappointed because I kept a lot of cash waiting for corrections, none of which happened. Now they are all expensive to me, I am stuck holding 50% in cash. I hate DCA.","All stocks are bought this year, since I started investing this year.

I bought Disney two months ago, practically at the bottom, for $90, expecting 25-30% growth in around a year, but now it's already at $115.

I bought United Airlines for $51 four months ago, practically right before the spike, now it's $90. At the same time bought Delta Airlines for 45$, now is 64$, but sold at 54$.

I bought Archer in May, at the bottom, for $3.20 now it's at $6.0. Even before the spike, I sold 70% of Archer shares, expecting to buy them for less later. Five days after the sale, they doubled. Bought Joby at the same time for 5.7, now is 7.1. I am convinced of the long-term success of these two companies.

Bought QQQ in March, now is 15% up and expensive. Planed to buy in November last year, but did not have the money. The most of the portfolio.

And now comes the most important thing, because of which I got pissed off:

In August bought RKLB at 5.7. Now: 23. And bought LUNR at 5.2, now: 14.

I was extremely convinced of the long-term success of RKLB and LUNR before I even heard there was a WSB subreddit and before I even heard they were popular stocks. That was my internal research unrelated to stock market trends. My plan was to buy them for long-term holding, at least 10 years. RKLB was my main planned investment. For LUNR, I wasn't so sure about the long-term success, but I certainly was for the short-term. I was 100% sure about RKLB. I wanted the best possible entry position. Bought RKLB for 5.7 and LUNR for 5.2. However, I only invested small percent of the planned sum, because I wanted to continue buying for less. I waited, waited, expecting some kind of correction, but after I bought them, they immediately went parabolic, and I was getting more and more angry and didn't want to buy until they fell significantly. They did not fall, but only went up. I even sold 30% of RKLB and LUNR at $11 and $8.1, expecting a correction so I could buy more shares for less. So I reduced the number of shares even more. Five days after the sale, this biggest spike followed. From 11 to 22, and from 8 to 14. While others can't wait to see their shares grow, I was pissed off with every movement up, because I was losing the chance to buy them at a lower price, and I certainly expected that success, just not this fast. Now I'm left with 50% of my money in cash, and only a total of 4% of my portfolio in RKLB and LUNR. So:

RKLB, LUNR, ACHR and Joby are for long term (QQQ included). The rest: until they recover.

The rest of portfolio (all bought last week) is: ASML, bought last week at 621e. (3% of portfolio), PDD Holdings and Baidu, bought couple days ago at 105$ and 82$ (total of 3.5% of portfolio). Also Google, bougt two days ago at 168$. I am planing Nike and Alibaba next days.

Also bought Planet Labs in August at the bootom for 2.1, now is 3.5. Sold at 2.3 because I was not sure in long-term success. Ten days after the sale went double.

Someone would say that I did very well, but I am extremely dissatisfied because the most important planned investments (RKLB, and then ACHR) got away from me, i.e. I only have 3 percent of the total portfolio in them, and only 6% in RKLB, ACHR, LUNR and Joby, which were my main long term targets.

Funding E-Trade account with Cash app,Has anybody successfully used this method to fund a brokerage account? I read somewhere that you could link an E-Trade debit card and use the instant transfer option to deposit funds into your account and that they would be immediately available to start trading with once it hit. Tried it last night with a small amount and to my surprise it worked. I then tried transferring a larger amount this morning and got a message saying “your bank declined this transaction” and to call them if I was having issues. Called earlier and was told that when you use Cash app to fund your account it’s “hit or miss” on whether it works or not and that they had no control over that so there wasn’t anything they could do on their end. They also mentioned something about Mastercard being the ones who were in control of the transaction and were the ones who decided if it was went through or not which didn’t make much sense to me.

I’ve been covering $NVDA since 2011 when it was worth just $0.35 per share (post-split adjusted that is). AMA about its latest earnings report. ,"**Update: Looks like we ran into sitewide issue right when things got started, I'll be back at noon ET to try this again!**   
  
Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022.

I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since.

Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with [the threat of increased competition](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-rivals-are-circling-but-theyre-still-years-from-catching-up-211621835.html) to [attending the company’s GTC conference](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-debuts-next-generation-blackwell-ai-chip-at-gtc-2024-205825161.html) to chatting with [CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/demand-is-just-so-strong-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-tells-yahoo-finance-supply-cant-keep-up-012653951.html).

With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like [AMD are gaining steam](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-debuts-latest-ai-chips-as-it-battles-rivals-nvidia-intel-180032426.html), and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant.

How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess.

In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips.

💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs  $33.2B expected  
💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected  
💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected

Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion.

I’ll be back tomorrow, Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. ET to answer your questions about Nvidia’s latest earnings, the market reaction, and where the stock goes from here.

"Doubt about [The Intelligent Investor]: Could this be an error?
","Chapter 2: The Investor and Inflation

\- Inflation and corporate earnings. (p. 51-52)

....""Our extended studies have led to the conclusion that the investor cannot count on much above the recent five-year rate earned on the DJIA group— about 10% on net tangible assets (book value) behind the shares. Since the market value of these issues is well above their book value—say, 900 market vs. 560 book in mid-1971—the earnings on current market price work out only at some 61⁄4%. (This relationship is generally expressed in the reverse, or “times earnings,” manner—e.g., that the DJIA price of 900 equals 18 times the actual earnings for the 12 months ended June 1971.)...""

It states that the market value of the stocks was 900, with an earnings yield of 6.25% (EPS = 56.25). Later, it mentions that this corresponds to a P/E ratio of 18 (""the DJIA price of 900 is equal to 18 times the actual earnings"").

However, when I calculate the P/E ratio, I get 16:

\\\[

\\text{P/E} = \\frac{\\text{Market Price}}{\\text{EPS}} = \\frac{900}{56.25} = 16

\\\]

So, I’m wondering:

1. Could the stated \*\*18\*\* in the book be an approximation or a rounded figure?
2. Or is there some other context or implicit calculation that justifies the value of 18?

Thanks in advance for any insights!",4,5,"Chapter 2 The Investor and Inflation

The volume is also has a firm hold on the current movement. 50EMA on the other hand can be a support after a retest and price may break out from right from current position.

Whats your take on FNMA/FMCC? ,"I just made a ton of money on FNMA since the end of the election. I know it’s a political play. 

Long story short. The 2008 housing crash left Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on the verge of bankruptcy, so they were put into government conservatorship. They received huge bailouts, which they have since paid back, but they remain under conservatorship today. 

They were trading almost 90 pps pre conservatorship then dropped to .20, now they’re up to 3.42 since the end of the election. I own 200k shares. So I’m invested financially and emotionally. 

Today’s sentiment by the trump administration is to release them from conservatorship. It could be a 20-50x pps jump next year. ",19,9,"I just made a ton of money on FNMA since the end of the election I know its a political play

How to Hedge Against Inflation: Thoughts on the Incoming Administration,"I’ve been thinking a lot about the incoming administration’s potential impact on inflation and the economy. Many of Trump’s proposed policies strike me as inherently inflationary. Here are some key points I’ve been considering:

1. **Mass Deportation:**
   * Disrupting this workforce will almost certainly induce inflation by increasing labor shortages and raising wages in certain sectors.
2. **Tariffs:**
   * Tariffs are another concern. Even if Trump walks back some of his campaign promises, tariffs are still inflationary.
3. **Cutting Government Jobs/Spending:**
   * This is sure to create economic strain.

**The Big Question:** Given these potential policies, where should I position myself in an inflationary environment???

* **Equities:**
   * Equities are often considered a hedge against inflation because companies can pass costs on to consumers. Housing also tends to be a good hedge, as property values often keep pace with inflation. However, at what point does sustained inflation trigger an **economic crash** or a sharp market sell-off?
* **Cash:**
   * Cash seems like a losing proposition during inflationary times, as its purchasing power erodes. But could there be a moment when the market correction makes holding cash advantageous? Warren Buffet seems to think so.
* **Tech Stocks:**
   * Imo tech stocks, particularly B2B companies, might be less impacted by these inflationary pressures. They’re less reliant on cheap labor and less vulnerable to tariffs. If there’s a broad market sell-off, I’d expect the S&P to take a hit initially, but I think tech might see breakouts later as inflationary impacts stabilize.

So, what do you all think? Where would you position yourself? Are there other sectors or strategies I’m overlooking?

Which high growth stock went higher than previous day high?,"These are high quality growth stocks that's trading higher than 13 weeks ago and higher than 52 weeks ago and have growth rate greater than 10% AND these had higher close today than previous trading day. It shows strong momentum to the upside but still we have to do our due diligence before opening new positions. My indicators on chart are as follows: Green cloud is 200 sma, Brown cloud is 50ema and the other two moving averages I have are 9/21 ema. If the price is above all the moving averages, that shows strong momentum to the up. On the bottom I have EPS (Earnings Per Share) and GPE - Price/Earnings to Growth which is also called PEG ratio. A lower PEG ratio indicates the stock is *undervalued.* An undervalued stock with high EPS ratio is good for long term hold.

"When the S&P 500 index is projected to grow its EPS by 20%, what factors still make individual stocks appealing to you?","I was reviewing a few stocks and found myself questioning why I should choose a specific business over the index. I thought that a quality individual business would surely grow its revenue and net income faster than the index.

Yield Curve Inversions ,"So it's pretty common knowledge that when the yield curve inverts it's bad. When the yield curve un-inverts a recession has followed 100% of the time.

People are always concerned about how long until the recession hits, but I thought what about market tops related to yield curve un-inversion......and do I have some news for you.

Here it is in short:


10 year minus 2 year

Average market top is 101 days after un-inversion. We are at 78 days!


10 year minus 3 month

Average market top is only 14 days after un-inversion.
It should un-invert next week!

I want to stress that I'm not looking to get rich or anything like that, I'm just wanting to learn.

Currently I have purchased stocks in the Financial, Defense, and Nuclear sectors and they have done quite well in the past few months. I learned that September, October, and November are particularly volatile months, but most of my stocks did pretty well and exceeded my expectations (I thought they would have all lost market value in this timeframe).

I am wondering what other industries or individual stocks I should look into? What patterns are there going to be in the next few months? Which stocks or industries will act in a unique way in accordance to these patterns?

RKLB,"I've been buying RKLB since it was worth around 11 dollars. I currently have around 500 dollars of RKLB and 600 dollars of VOO in my portfolio. Is it worth getting RKLB and selling VOO? I believe RKLB has loads of potential and that the stock will shoot up as soon as they get a successful Neutron launch out of the way. Also, despite what some are fearing, I doubt Elon would interfere in RKLB's business. Neutron is not a F9 competitor for now and until they can get their cadence up, it won't even be. A Trump presidency does not seem like that much of a risk. Especially with Elon fighting for things like deregulation, which will help everyone including RKLB.

"These are the stocks on my watchlist (11/13)
","Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader.

This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold some/all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts.

I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved.

PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Why isn’t \_\_\_ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion.  If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you- doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update.

Today looks to be the day that the market experiences some minor pullback. Largely watching the same momentum stocks I have for the past few days.

"Waymo opens robotaxi service to anyone in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet","Waymo, Alphabet’s autonomous vehicle subsidiary, has expanded its robotaxi service across nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles, marking its largest rollout yet. Starting Tuesday, Angelenos can use the Waymo One app to hail a self-driving taxi throughout the city, a significant step after over 300,000 residents joined the waitlist. This expansion makes LA the third major city with Waymo's robotaxi service, following Phoenix and San Francisco.

The company’s rapid growth has been fueled by a recent $5.6 billion funding round, led by Alphabet with contributions from Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, and others. Currently, Waymo handles over 150,000 weekly rides across its markets, up from 100,000 in August.

Netflix ad-supported tier has 70 million monthly users two years after launch,"Netflix's ad-supported tier has gained significant traction, reaching 70 million monthly users globally two years after its launch in November 2022. The tier, introduced as a response to slowing subscriber growth, has become a popular choice, with over 50% of new sign-ups opting for the ad-supported plan in countries where it's available. Netflix credits this tier with helping boost membership numbers, reporting 282.7 million total subscribers across all pricing options last quarter.

The company is also seeing success with its advertising inventory, having sold out for two live NFL games on Christmas Day, a result of its three-year deal with the NFL. Advertisers like FanDuel, which will be the exclusive pregame sportsbook partner, and Verizon are lined up for the games. Netflix’s focus on ad-supported growth aligns with a broader industry shift towards affordable, ad-driven streaming options, as media companies seek new revenue streams in an increasingly competitive landscape. Starting next year, Netflix plans to pivot its performance reporting from subscriber numbers to revenue and other financial metrics, signaling a new phase in its growth strategy.

These are the stocks on my watchlist (11/12),"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed!

Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts.

Hypothetical question about LTCG,"So I I've recently seen some information about LTCG tax and federal employees that if they fall in the right bracket pay 0%. Is this true regardless of federal employment?

So onto the core question.

Let's say you're an individual who's shares are equal to billions of dollars. If you wanted to make those liquid you'd have to sell and pay a tax if I understand correctly.

So what if you worked in some capacity for the U.S. federal government and if done correctly you could dump shares and make billions of dollars liquid and pay 0% or as low of a tax as possible. 
Does this seem logical or am I missing something.

"Best ""turnaround"" stories in the market
","There are a few turnaround stories that appear to be going according to plan (Starbucks, $SBUX) and a few that aren't (Boeing, $BA). Whatever your view may be on a company, what are some companies/stocks that are currently in ""turnaround"" mode? Whether that be new leadership, updated product lines, or fresh culture.

I find it interesting to study, track, and ultimately research these companies to find things that work(ed). For example, I have kept up with the never-ending Boeing ($BA) saga of consistently defective quality. But the one thing that BA has going for it is that America *needs* Boeing, and given there's a duopoly of planes in the world (Boeing and Airbus), America is evermore invested and interested in Boeing survival.

Give your opinion on my DCF analysis on different companies,"I've done a Google Sheets table where I do valuation on different companies so that I am able to get to the intrinsic value. I use the TTM Free Cash Flow and project its growth.

I'll show my table with it's assumptions so you can tell me whether they should realistic or I should adjust some variable to be more realistic. I understand that these assumptions are optimistic but I am also optimistic about the companies so the numbers make sense to me.

Last week's high volume stocks,"* **TSLA -** Tesla saw massive move to the up and it has now gone in over extended territory. Do not chase and wait for it to dip to support level at 271.28, 
* **BAC** \- Crossed over resistance of 44.26 and retested that level. It should keep going higher under lower interest rate environment. My immediate target (resistance) is at 47.24
* **MSFT** \- Good stock to go/stay longs. Unlike many other stocks that's hitting ATH, MSFT still hasn't flown away to hit the ATH. It's not the question IF, the question is WHEN. Immediate resistance is at 438/439.
* **UPST** \- Upstart had great earnings and the stock went up by 24% in a day after earnings. The next immediate resistance is sitting between 86-95
* **META** \- Meta is going in a range at this point. The support is sitting at 558-569 and price coming to that area will be nicely bought.
* **INTC** \- Intel had nice weekly bullish candle. There are few pivot (support) levels: 24.71, 23.56, 22.12. My immediate target is at 27.86 where it can face some resistance.
* **AAPL** \- Apple has been going in a range. We need to look for a breakout/down. A close below 213 is a breakdown whereas close above 238 in daily chart will be a breakout.

I'm extremely bullish on TSLA. ,"I just had hand surgery so I'm writing this one-handed, but during my recovery I did nothing but look at TSLA charts. I've never been a big believer of technical analysis and I know some people ride and die for support levels but honestly I find it can be quite distracting and not very useful. In this case, however, we can notice a pattern of bag holders who have FOMO'd into something they've wanted to sell for a quick buck and then had to bear the pain sometimes for years. A good deal of those sold at a loss at some point but TSLA's Market Cap is still made up in some part of people in the red. These people have been waiting to cash in for years and at this point they're not gonna sell unless it at least hits a historic high. So I do believe that a price of $400 is, at least for now, an important support level for this stock, and if I know the dude-bro culture that is largely responsible of this rally, I'd actually say $420 is an ever more reasonable price within the next 2 months.

"Passive Investing: Benefits, Challenges, and the Hybrid Approach","This is a long one, so I made interim summaries to keep the main points clear.

I'm working on a quant model aimed at outperforming the SPY at similar risk levels. The motivation behind this is the challenge of choosing the right passive products and the fact that most managed portfolios have underperformed the SPY.

Would love to hear your thoughts on the hybrid model I’m working on or any experience you’ve had with quant models.

Thanks!

**So, let's start...**  
  
The meteoric rise in popularity of the passive investment approach is overall a positive trend for retail investors. However, there’s one critical point I’d like to emphasize—there’s no such thing as truly passive investing. At least, not in an absolute sense. So, after dropping that bombshell, let me dive into the details.

# Passive Investing

The passive investment approach is based on studies showing that the chances of outperforming the benchmark or market return through active portfolio management are notably low. Yes, some fund managers manage to beat the index, and they often make headlines. But studies reveal that a manager who has beaten their chosen benchmark doesn’t necessarily keep outperforming it consistently.

So, a manager might have a good year, or even a few. But in the long run—this is the key point—it just doesn’t work. Another aspect of these studies is that even if a skilled manager can beat the benchmark, the likelihood of investors finding and choosing that manager among all others is, in itself, quite low.

**Interim Summary:** *Fund managers don’t consistently beat the index, and investors don’t consistently pick the managers who do.*

# Passive Investment Products

The widespread success and understanding of passive investing benefits are visible in the huge range of passive investment products. This vast supply reflects high demand but also creates complexity, which I’ll highlight further.

Passive products, like index-tracking ETFs, are diversified, have low management fees, and enable investors to follow indexes or groups of stocks based on common themes like blockchain, electric vehicles, robotics, cannabis, and more.

As of August 2024, nearly 3,500 ETFs trade on Wall Street, most of them passively managed. Their numbers grow at an impressive double-digit rate year-over-year. But as I previously mentioned, this impressive supply adds complexity, effectively introducing active elements into the passive approach.

# The Small and Medium problems of Passive Investing

While studies highlight the effectiveness of the passive approach, it’s particularly efficient over the long term, with research recommending at least a 15-year period. Here’s why:

* In 2008, the S&P 500 fell by 50% during the subprime crisis.
* In 2018, the S&P dropped 20% between September and October.
* At the start of 2020, amid the COVID-19 outbreak, the S&P lost 34% in just a few weeks.
* In 2022, the S&P completed a 27% decline from its peak.

**Don’t get me wrong—I’m a proponent of passive investing**. But it’s crucial to grasp this long-term factor. Index investing is risky, even over the long term. The risk remains constant year after year, but the ability to recover from declines is the game-changer in passive investing—the long-term horizon is essential.

**Interim Summary:** *Passive investments are effective over the long term, yet most investors struggle to commit to this time frame, and in any case, the choices of tracked index and tracking product are active decisions.*

# Macro and Micro Risks

Investment risks can be simplified into two categories—macro and micro risks. Looking at passive investing through a risk lens can clarify why it’s so efficient. Essentially, with passive products (index-tracking investments), we neutralize micro risks, as broad diversification protects us from risks associated with specific companies.

Conversely, macro risks persist even in passive investments. Passive investing counters macro risks by relying on the investment horizon—the longer the time frame, the greater the ability to recover from downturns.

**Interim Summary:** *Passive investing uniquely addresses both micro and macro risks. In contrast, active investing is exposed to both types of risks and tries to mitigate them through research and forecasting. As we’ve seen, most managers fail to manage these risks effectively and lag behind the indexes over time.*

# The Hybrid Investment Approach – Something Different

Taking a middle path, Hybrid Invest uses passive instruments exclusively, neutralizing micro risks like passive investing. Here, hybrid management comes into play, combining active and passive approaches.

In a nutshell, the hybrid investment approach focuses solely on macro risk analysis, using a fixed formula or quantitative model that is unaffected by investor psychology. The result is a portfolio aligned with macroeconomic trends. The implementation remains passive—the portfolio consists of highly liquid, central ETFs. Unlike the active approach, it disregards the microeconomic environment, focusing on index-tracking products.

**Let's revisit the large and small asterisks of passive investing. It’s clear that the hybrid approach addresses both in two ways: (1) adaptation to the macroeconomic environment reduces reliance on the investment horizon, and (2) it offers an active element in selecting the index-tracking product at the core of the passive approach.**

These are the stocks on my watchlist (11/8),"Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader.

  
This is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold some/all MAG 7 stocks and market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations; I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions. I use IBKR TWS for my platform and charts.

I am targeting potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. This means the potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, not the business, long-term prospects, or the people involved.

PLEASE ask specific questions and PLEASE don’t ask about earnings because I typically don’t take positions before earnings announcements. Questions like “Thoughts on \_\_\_\_\_?” or “Why isn’t \_\_\_ on the watchlist?” or something answered already will be ignored unless you add detail and your opinion. If you post a question and delete it after I answer it, I will block you - doing that hurts discussion. I am not answering questions if I’m still long or short a stock beyond what I update.

Shift4 up 90% in a year. Can this growth continue?,"I haven't seen many analysts covering Shift4 Payments, but its up 90% in the last 12 months.

The company IPO'd at $35 in 2020, and is now trading around $90. 

The 40-year old founder, Jared Isaacman, was part of the first all-civilian spacewalk in September, which must have brought in some extra attention.

But apparently, FOUR's Q2 financials back up the growth too:

* **End-to-end payment volume:** \+50% 
* **Cash from operating activity:** \+26%
* **Revenue growth:** \+30%
* **Gross profit:** \+38%

Interestingly, the CEO’s latest update mentioned that most of their transactions happen through their own software, which makes it hard for customers to leave.

AKA they have a system to keep clients locked in.

Lone wolf investing. ,"Does anyone find among their peer group/family that everyone is just kind of blind when it comes to investing other than a workplace 401k plan? For example, I am 30 and when I try to talk to my friends about investing or getting them to invest it always goes in one ear and out the other or they think there is no point. These same people will complain about the economy and gas/grocery prices etc. and when you try to tell them thats the whole point of why you need to be investing they just don’t believe it or think it only benefits “rich” people. Now i get it home prices are insane and a real problem, but had I not started investing from 2019 instead of saying “there is no point” and just complained the whole time I would not have the 20k extra from the market gains apart from my contributions I made in my non retirement account from 2019 up until now. I literally used to doordash for three years with my Honda civic and only made about 20-25k net doing that eventually got a low level call center role at a brokerage firm where i was able to increase investing even more and am in a lot better place financially because of it, hell it has even helped my lifelong depression.

Money DOES NOT cure depression or make us happy, but it has made it a little better as I have been diagnosed with major depression since a child. And honestly just like eating more healthy investing has helped in a way as anyone who deals with depression knows there is no cure really but I have found investing has helped me a lot not only by providing more stability but as a way to distract my mind and read about it etc. 

Anyways, I say all of this to just see has anyone else’s experience been similar to where you see people struggling etc and maybe they don’t have ideal jobs, but they still choose to complain or blame politics for their suffering? I mean like I said I literally was a doordash driver for 3 years out of college due to covid and weak job market at that time for my studies fresh out of college and still found a way to put some money back I don’t get it. Even if its only 20 dollars a week 20 dollars a week compounded is still better than 0 5-10 years down the road.

Im just not buying all of the complaining I see all over social media. I see plenty of the MAGA types complaining just as much as I see the plenty other democrats complain as well. I just feel blessed to kind of not be blinded I guess and found out about investing early on in life and actually believed in it. Anyone else feel similar, kinda like a feeling of like you are the only one walking g around with a different set of eyes because of the markets and feeling better because of it?

Trading dividends,"Ok I just thought about something, it has to be a stupid idea... and I can't possibly be the first one to think about it, so it probably doesn't work but I can't find why it wouldn't work so I'm reaching out to get a small dose of reality.

Here is my understanding, please tell me where I'm wrong:

Dividend stocks or funds have an __ex dividend date__: the date you need to hold the stock and when dividend is declared.

For example the fund `TSX: Bank` had an ex dividend date of Oct 31st, and declared a 0.11$CaD dividend

That amount is paid on the payment day of Nov 7th.

So my money just need to be tied between Oct31st and Nov 7th?

 __For the rest of the month, why can't I sell BANK and buy another dividend stock/fund and just make sure I buy Bank again a day before the next ex-dividend?__
