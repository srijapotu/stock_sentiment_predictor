Investing in AI infrastructure?,"
I’m interested in investing in the data centers, servers, and related opportunities driven by AI. What do you think? Individual AI software winners may be hard to pick, but surely the server farms are needed anyway. Is there an opportunity, and how are you exploiting it? With long experience in the software business I am aware that the AI world is maturing, but has a long way to go. I am sure we will see stories of AI-driven project failures. Equally, I’m sure we’ll see stories about great successes. But whichever way it goes there will be vast investment. So are you focusing your investments on AI platforms (if so, which), or hardware (Nvidia and others)  or Data Center REITs (American Tower, Equinix) or things like the Global X ETFs (which seem underperforming to me).

"Assaults, Cover-ups, Ruined Reputation, and a 51% Stock Drop — Any Chance For Wynn Resorts?","So here is the full story of one of the biggest stock drops of WYNN (though they haven’t recovered till this day). Also, anyone here with $WYNN? What’s your thoughts about it?   


[**https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/11/42050388/high-stakes-and-higher-scandals-inside-wynn-resorts-legal-and-ethical-crisis**](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/24/11/42050388/high-stakes-and-higher-scandals-inside-wynn-resorts-legal-and-ethical-crisis)  


First things first: Steve Wynn, the company’s founder, was key to its brand and success, as they positioned it. But then, in January 2018, the Wall Street Journal revealed sexual misconduct allegations against him, backed by over 150 interviews.  
  
  
These allegations, some dating back decades, led to investigations by Nevada and Massachusetts regulators. Both found Wynn guilty and uncovered a cover-up by senior executives (what a shocker, right?). The result was a staggering $55M in fines for the company.  


After that, the market reaction was fast. $WYNN stock plunged 18% in just days, triggering a lawsuit from investors. They accused the company of hiding Wynn’s misconduct and exposing them to financial risk.  
  


Now, after years of legal battles, Wynn Resorts has agreed to pay a $70M settlement. So, if you owned shares during this time, you might be eligible to submit a claim.



While the company has taken steps to rebuild its reputation — like securing a UAE gaming license, reducing debt, and launching a $1B share buyback program — $WYNN still trades at $93, down 51% from its 2018 peak of $192.



And, has anyone here been affected by this? How much were your losses if so?",3,1,"So here is the full story of one of the biggest stock drops of WYNN though they havent recovered till this day Also anyone here with WYNN Whats your thoughts about it

I'm excited and nervous. as well with making the wrong chices, but I’m ready to give it a go and learn as much as I can along the way. Here’s where I’m at:

I’ve invested €400 into a Swedish index fund that focuses on the global tech sector yesterday. It’s been having quite a good 30% growth in the past six months. My plan is to hold onto it for six to nine months and see where it goes.

* Which sectors are looking strong right now? Besides tech, are there industries that could really shine over the next six months?

How are smaller companies having such a bad 1-2 years lately but big companies are booming?,"How are smaller companies in good fields taking such a hit over the last 1-2 years but big companies continue to boom?

I’m no expert but that just seems crazy and so inorganic. I get that the company’s themselves aren’t doing well or might have a bad financial year but down 90% or more in a year or two just doesn’t really make sense to me. 

For it to drop like that, it obviously means people are selling but in order for those sales to go through that means people are still buying the stock so somebody still believes in the company. 

And like they could have a bad year where revenue is down 25% or more than previous years, so how does that justify a 90% drop? Or maybe they’re running low on cash, and really the only way to raise cash to help their situation is issuing shares, or a reverse split or whatever. If cash on hand is their biggest problem, wouldn’t making the stock price go up help the company and then lead to more growth? Granted cash-on-hand is probably hardly the biggest factors in these drops but just trying to grow my knowledge. 

I thought the stock market kinda went hand-in-hand in a sense that when big companies are growing, the little ones also follow, kinda like in 2020-2021, now it seems to be the opposite

I guess is that just the difference between big companies and small ones? When hard times come, the big ones are able to adjust and recover and the smaller ones just get destroyed?

And to finish it off, how do you tell the difference between companies that have no hope and will most likely be bankrupt soon, versus those that will most likely make a comeback and recover from being down 90% or more. I feel like it could be a great time to put a little bit of money in these smaller companies but don’t really know how to tell if they’re gonna last or not

Huge Insider Buying at Prospect Capital $PSEC,"Prospect capital's share price took a big hit last month and it was due to an audio forcing them to take a loss on investments that will bring in revenue soon. This dividend stock is way undervalued. And the insider buying lately backs up that thesis.

The CEO has purchased nearly 4.2 million shares or over $20 million! he takes 0 Salary! The President has a salary of 175K and has purchase about that in shares! Every day this week I get SEC filings saying they are buying more. See for yourself:

[https://www.prospectstreet.com/investors/Docs/InsiderFilings/](https://www.prospectstreet.com/investors/Docs/InsiderFilings/)

Yesterday somebody I follow took a call from the company and told us this:

""The Chief Credit Officer at PSEC called me about 11am yesterday. Steven Stone. I was surprised it was from a cell phone. We spoke in February for about 50 mins as well. I have actually met the CEO 3x, last about 13 years ago at an annual shareholders meeting. I first attended in my 20s, was in the city. 1 thing you should know about PSEC is that it is a super defensive stock. The idea is, it is supposed to stay level, about 6, and supposed to give you near 12% in dividends, while having a steady price… We can see that has happened in this market, but that is the idea. It is always good to diversify… I had called and thought the drop off was do to their main REIT business. That business has about 70 multi family properties. Some with 100s of units. Those properties are not prime areas, they are 2^(nd)/3^(rd) tier.. They cash flow well, but on paper, they can depreciate, the asset value, prime can depreciate a lot! So this quarter the value of the REITS were written down much harder than the past, this is determined by their auditor… Every quarter there 117 investments must be appraised…. The loss and bad quarter is on 3 companies. 1 of which they finally did take a write off of near 120 million! PGX a credit repair service. The original owners took out nearly 200 million loan. When they could no longer pay the loan back, as the Govt fined and halted the business, they could not pay it… So PSEC took it over. It has a lot of upside, the margins there are high. We had spoke about this in February and had hoped that the service would be up and running. But it is still shut down, so the auditor forced them to take the loss… This is on paper! They didn’t lose the cash, the cash was loaned out. Hence the EPS will look bad.. They did earn less income because the other 2 of 3 that messed this quarter up, are failing. PSEC suspended interest payments on these 2. 1 of these holds a 180 million loan. PSEC cut the dividend and has chosen to take over these 2 businesses for a turn around. When turned they may sell the business and reap rewards.. Personally, hearing about these other 2, EH! But the credit repair is a cash cow.""

Energy Fuels $UUUU DD,"**Overview**

Energy Fuels, together with its subsidiaries, engages in the extraction, recovery, recycling, exploration, permitting, evaluation, and sale of uranium mineral properties in the United States. The company produces and sells vanadium pentoxide, rare earth elements, and heavy mineral sands such as ilmenite, rutile, zircon, and monazite.

**Explanation of Element and Mineral Importance**

**Uranium –** This is the fuel for nuclear reactors. Please see my post on Uranium if you want to understand the significance of it, and why Energy Fuels will massively benefit from it. Link Here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g51fj0/get\_in\_on\_uranium\_now/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g51fj0/get_in_on_uranium_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

 

**Vanadium** is a key component in vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), which are used for energy storage systems. Due to shifts toward renewable energy sources, the demand for efficient, large-scale energy storage is increasing. VRFBs are particularly suited for grid storage due to their scalability, long lifespan, and ability to discharge over a long period, making vanadium an essential material for the emerging clean energy economy. This shift represents a significant growth driver for the vanadium market as energy storage technologies become increasingly vital.

https://preview.redd.it/8jf3r5ebv93e1.png?width=809&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9db23e3e0e6bc655f2972abc967ae3283ac808e

**SWOT on VRFBs (Guidehouse Insights)**

The nuclear energy sector represents a significant opportunity for vanadium products. Vanadium alloys are highly valuable due to their low neutron-absorption characteristics and high temperature and corrosion resistance. These properties make vanadium-based alloys ideal for use in nuclear reactors, particularly in the construction of pressure vessels and structural components. The ability of vanadium alloys to withstand the harsh operating environments inside a nuclear reactor without significant degradation, extends the service life of these components, enhancing the overall safety and efficiency of nuclear power plants.

Vanadium is also used in the aerospace industry and plays a huge role in the steel industry as well, due to its ability to enhance the strength and durability of steel.

**Rare Earth Elements (REE’s)**

**NdPr –** A combination of two rare earth elements: Neodymium (Nd) and Praseodymium (Pr). These elements are both crucial in the production of high-strength permanent magnets. Their powerful magnetic properties are essential in: Electric vehicles, wind turbines, consumer electronics, and defense technologies. Energy Fuels is one of the few US companies able to commercialize the production of separated NdPr.

**Growth Projection for REEs in Energy Transition (Source: Adamas Intelligence)**

 

**NdFeB Magnets and Why They Are Important**

Neodymium-Iron-Boron Magnets are a type of permanent magnet. They are the strongest commercially available magnet offering high magnetic strength while being lightweight and compact. With the energy transition going on, demand for these magnets is increasing significantly YoY.

**NdFeB Magnet Content**

As we can see in the chart, NdPr accounts for about a third of NdFeB magnets composition.

**Heavy Mineral Sands**

**Ilmenite –** Mined and processed to produce titanium oxide (TiO2). TiO2 is used in paints, coatings, and plastics which allows UUUU to diversify their revenue further into industrial areas.

**Zircon –** Used for manufacturing ceramics, refractory materials, and foundry molds. Also used in the medical industry for things like dental and orthopedic implants, and for PET imaging which is used for cancer diagnostics.

**Rutile –** Similar to ilmenite, rutile has a superior quality of titanium content making it more valuable.

**Monazite –** A rare mineral that contains rare-earth elements and uranium. Used as a feedstock by Energy Fuels in their processing endeavors. NdPr is extracted from Monazite as well as the minerals mentioned above.

https://preview.redd.it/s4y482vev93e1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=29e6c68d972ac33b6d0b22506f6c5168fb1f924a

**White Mesa Mill**

·         100% owned by Energy Fuels, is the only facility in the USA able to process Monazite to produce REE’s.

·         The only fully licensed and operating conventional uranium mill in the US.

·         Completed “Phase 1” REE facility with up to 1,000 tonnes of separated NdPr production capacity.

·         Largest producer of Vanadium in the US. (Production on standby currently due to low prices, strong inventory on hand.

Average revenue growth for the last 3 years has been 196%.

The negative EBITDA is not something to worry about. Mining sites are not easy to develop and require a lot of funding. Although, once these mines are up and running, heavy mineral sands mining is low cost. They are continuing to focus on creating revenue generating assets. The company has essentially zero debt and very few liabilities, with assets that doubled from 2020 to 2023. In the next year, I believe we will see positive EBITDA due to mines becoming operational, instead of sitting idle.

·         Strong uranium inventory consisting of 235,000 pounds finished U3O8. 805,000 pounds of U3O8 in ore and raw materials. Expects inventory to continue increasing due to mining operations.

·         A large vanadium inventory of 905,000 pounds finished V2O5.

**Acquisition of RadTran LLC**

On August 19^(th), 2024, Energy Fuels announced it acquired RadTran, a private company specializing in the separation of critical radioisotopes. Since 2021, Energy Fuels and RadTran have been working together to evaluate the feasibility of recovering radium-226 and radium-228 from uranium processing at White Mesa Mill. These recovered isotopes would be made available to the pharmaceutical industry and others to enable the production of acintium-225 and lead-212. These isotopes are critical components in the development of targeted alpha therapies which offer promising new treatments for various cancers. There is currently a global shortage of Ra-226 and Ra-228, therefore limiting the supply of Ac-225 and Pb-212. This is a huge acquisition for Energy Fuels as medical isotopes possess immense demand.

**Acquisition of Base Resources**

On October 2^(nd), 2024, Energy Fuels announced the completion of its acquisition of Base Resources. This is expected to transform the company into a global leader in critical mineral production, including titanium, zirconium, REEs, and uranium. This is huge for the company as they brought in world class management and operations capability while gaining ownership over the Toliara Project in Madagascar. This is widely considered by industry experts to be one of the best HMS (heavy mineral sands) projects in the world.

**Conclusion**

I think this is a company with massive potential to be a large player in the supply chain for Vanadium and REEs. With a stockpile of 905,000 pounds of V2O5, they are easily able to capitalize on growing demand. They are also in a great position to capitalize on the growing domestic market for uranium, as we continuously rely less on foreign nations. With 235,000 pounds of inventory on hand and a production capability of 1.1-1.4 million pounds of U3O8 per year, the company will be able to profit from further spot sales and long-term contracts. With strategic acquisitions of Base Resources and RadTran, the company clearly demonstrates commitment to growth and innovation. At a current price of **$6.90**, I believe within 2 years this company will triple in price to around **$20**.",8,3,"Overview

$Dell Earnings,"I wanted to get everyone’s take on DELL (down nearly 11% after hours.) I bought 106 shares at 130.5 during their recent run. Didn’t sell today because I like their growth prospects wanted to exit around $150.

The company seems solid, especially with its strength in enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure, even though consumer PC sales have been an ongoing problem. Despite this Dell has been doubling down on AI, data centers, and hybrid cloud, which I believe should set them up well for growth in 2025. They also stand to benefit from SMCI’s issues and Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs pushing demand for their infrastructure.

What caused the major sell down across major world indices in early August?,"Hey everyone,

I have recently started diving into world indices and looking more closely at the trends in global markets. One thing that caught my attention was the significant sell-off in early August 2023 that affected major indices across the globe.

From what I have gathered, there were a number of factors at play, but I am curious to hear your thoughts on what really drove the market downturn. Was it mostly due to economic data (like inflation), bond yields, geopolitical tensions, or something else?

I have been reading about the impact of U.S. inflation, rising bond yields, and concerns over China’s economic slowdown, but I would love to hear from others who have more experience with this. What do you think caused this major sell-off, and how did it affect different global indices?

Looking forward to hearing your insights!",1,4,"Hey everyone

I am 44 years old and I have been casually saving over the past few years and had my money in a high-interest savings account that was getting 5.25% I saved up about 16k so far and I was hoping to make more than 50 dollars a month interest.

Should I leave it where I have it? YTD performance is 24% and has done well over the past few years. Last year it was 30+ %. Again I have read a lot of people saying to invest in ETFs.

Opening an account other than 401k?,"

Hi everyone,

I started my career a few months ago and have been fortunate enough to have some expendable income. I’m currently contributing about $1,000 per month to my company’s 401k. My portfolio is allocated as follows: 60% in an S&P 500 index fund, 25% in a blue chip growth fund, and 15% in a 2065 target date fund. Originally, all my contributions were going to the 2065 fund, but I shifted to a more aggressive strategy since I'm only 23.

I'm considering opening another account to invest in individual stocks, as I'm somewhat limited in my current 401k options. I can afford an additional $500 per month for this. However, I'm also debating whether it would be better to just increase my 401k contributions, considering the tax advantages.

What do you all think? Should I diversify with individual stocks, or focus on maximizing my 401k?

2. Don’t pick shit stocks stick with the best names.
3. Don’t play options, ever.
4. Diversify. Everyone and their own way of doing this. Find which way works best for you.  
5. Don’t think about getting rich overnight, it takes years of DCA and scaling into a bigger portfolio and also where you will see best results(5-10+ years)
6. Always focus on maxing Roth IRA before brokerage. 
7. Why settle for the 2nd best when you can buy the best?(example; NVDA consistently outperformed AMD)
8. You should have less than 30(I have less than 10) stocks overall. You don’t want 300 stocks worth a few dollars, when you can have 10 or 30 worth a few thousand.

Google on the run or Google on the run?,"Can we talk about google for a second? Everyone keeps touting it as a good deal right now - assuming that Google will always rebound. But 90% (or so) of Google's income comes from their search business - which is slowly dying. 

As a digital native I've worked a lot with Google's products and I've used google like everyone else to an extent where it is part of my everyday life. But now... Not so much. I have to admit - I'm finding myself searching very rarely. Yeah, I'm using maps and gmail and so on - but the moat on those businesses is not very high. My gut - as their core consumer - is telling me that I don't need google as much as I used to. And honestly, for the first time every where I've actively reflected on it - I totally can imagine a world without google.

So, I'm not so sure we are going back to an all dominant Google again, and instead of assuming that Google will be the mastodont forever, I can more rationally imagine a scenario where the business slowly adapts into niches over time. Think Kodak etc.

Thanks for your time.

",0,11,"Can we talk about google for a second Everyone keeps touting it as a good deal right now  assuming that Google will always rebound But 90 or so of Googles income comes from their search business  which is slowly dying 

As a digital native Ive worked a lot with Googles products and Ive used google like everyone else to an extent where it is part of my everyday life But now Not so much I have to admit  Im finding myself searching very rarely Yeah Im using maps and gmail and so on  but the moat on those businesses is not very high My gut  as their core consumer  is telling me that I dont need google as much as I used to And honestly for the first time every where Ive actively reflected on it  I totally can imagine a world without google

Newcomer stock & mobile app advice?,"Hello, I’m considering taking 5k from my 401k so I can play with the stocks a bit myself. Not much experience made some $ years back on the weed stocks. The stocks I was considering are GE, Nvidia, Google, and Tesla. Was going to maybe evenly contribute amongst these stocks. Any words of advice or stocks I should include/avoid? 
Short term return also applicable would consider selling and banking profits and leaving the initial 5k in the market.
One more thing, a good app for stock trading? I’ve used Robinhood a bit and love the layout. I’ve had fidelity before it just wasn’t as simplified. I don’t like Robinhood because the stuff they pulled during AMC GME & and I turned stock lending on with the accidental click of a button. Not something I’d like to have investments in.

Robinhood Legend is...ehh..,"Robinhood Legend is...ehh.

So I finally had the chance to login and unlocking Legend and although it is customizable (to an extent), it STILL lacks a variety of chart overlays and indicators.

I was sure that Robinhood would unload a ton of indicators that are found in other reading platforms, but it seems as though they thought the new interactive chart would be enough to carry it's weight on its own.

Nope. Not even close.

You're only allowed 4 indicators total and 6 overlays. 6 overlays are a bit much, however, 4 indicators doesn't do it justice. For me, I like to have the following indicators giving me information: TTM, W/R, AROON, CCI, & EFI.

W/R doesn't exist on Legend, nor does TTM, W/E, or EFI... bummer.

Additionally, I only use Pivot Points & 4 SMAs (10, 20, 50, & 200).

All in all, I don't believe Legend is worth it's own weight. You have more indicators and options on the mobile app... Which is crazy to me.

I'm a subscribed Finviz user so I'll continue to use that chart scheme versus Legend until serious changes are added to it.

Other than that, what are your thoughts on the new Legend.

Mrna looks a little undervalued ,"Was looking at MRNA heating up a lil bit off its low this year around 35.80. 1st winning week on decent volume too. Have to go back to about April of 2020 for these prices. But just in general it seems to be trading way off its averages. 

My thought is that the new administration won’t be as anti vax as medias make them out to be and MRNA will do just fine if not better if regulations open up.

"An unusual problem: All the stocks I bought this year went instantly up, and I'm disappointed because I kept a lot of cash waiting for corrections, none of which happened. Now they are all expensive to me, I am stuck holding 50% in cash. I hate DCA.","All stocks are bought this year, since I started investing this year.

I bought Disney two months ago, practically at the bottom, for $90, expecting 25-30% growth in around a year, but now it's already at $115.

I bought United Airlines for $51 four months ago, practically right before the spike, now it's $90. At the same time bought Delta Airlines for 45$, now is 64$, but sold at 54$.

I bought Archer in May, at the bottom, for $3.20 now it's at $6.0. Even before the spike, I sold 70% of Archer shares, expecting to buy them for less later. Five days after the sale, they doubled. Bought Joby at the same time for 5.7, now is 7.1. I am convinced of the long-term success of these two companies.

Bought QQQ in March, now is 15% up and expensive. Planed to buy in November last year, but did not have the money. The most of the portfolio.

And now comes the most important thing, because of which I got pissed off:

In August bought RKLB at 5.7. Now: 23. And bought LUNR at 5.2, now: 14.

I was extremely convinced of the long-term success of RKLB and LUNR before I even heard there was a WSB subreddit and before I even heard they were popular stocks. That was my internal research unrelated to stock market trends. My plan was to buy them for long-term holding, at least 10 years. RKLB was my main planned investment. For LUNR, I wasn't so sure about the long-term success, but I certainly was for the short-term. I was 100% sure about RKLB. I wanted the best possible entry position. Bought RKLB for 5.7 and LUNR for 5.2. However, I only invested small percent of the planned sum, because I wanted to continue buying for less. I waited, waited, expecting some kind of correction, but after I bought them, they immediately went parabolic, and I was getting more and more angry and didn't want to buy until they fell significantly. They did not fall, but only went up. I even sold 30% of RKLB and LUNR at $11 and $8.1, expecting a correction so I could buy more shares for less. So I reduced the number of shares even more. Five days after the sale, this biggest spike followed. From 11 to 22, and from 8 to 14. While others can't wait to see their shares grow, I was pissed off with every movement up, because I was losing the chance to buy them at a lower price, and I certainly expected that success, just not this fast. Now I'm left with 50% of my money in cash, and only a total of 4% of my portfolio in RKLB and LUNR. So:

RKLB, LUNR, ACHR and Joby are for long term (QQQ included). The rest: until they recover.

The rest of portfolio (all bought last week) is: ASML, bought last week at 621e. (3% of portfolio), PDD Holdings and Baidu, bought couple days ago at 105$ and 82$ (total of 3.5% of portfolio). Also Google, bougt two days ago at 168$. I am planing Nike and Alibaba next days.

Also bought Planet Labs in August at the bootom for 2.1, now is 3.5. Sold at 2.3 because I was not sure in long-term success. Ten days after the sale went double.

Someone would say that I did very well, but I am extremely dissatisfied because the most important planned investments (RKLB, and then ACHR) got away from me, i.e. I only have 3 percent of the total portfolio in them, and only 6% in RKLB, ACHR, LUNR and Joby, which were my main long term targets.

I’ve been covering $NVDA since 2011 when it was worth just $0.35 per share (post-split adjusted that is). AMA about its latest earnings report. ,"**Update: Looks like we ran into sitewide issue right when things got started, I'll be back at noon ET to try this again!**   
  
Hi! I’m Dan Howley, the tech editor at Yahoo Finance, and Nvidia has seemingly been at the forefront of virtually everything I’ve covered since ChatGPT hit the scene in 2022.

I’ve been covering the tech space for 13 years and tracking Nvidia for even longer. I built my first desktop PC with an Nvidia graphics card in high school and have continued using its products ever since.

Now I, like everyone else, am focused on Nvidia’s AI efforts, from reporting on how they’re dealing with [the threat of increased competition](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-rivals-are-circling-but-theyre-still-years-from-catching-up-211621835.html) to [attending the company’s GTC conference](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-debuts-next-generation-blackwell-ai-chip-at-gtc-2024-205825161.html) to chatting with [CEO Jensen Huang alongside my colleague Julie Hyman](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/demand-is-just-so-strong-nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-tells-yahoo-finance-supply-cant-keep-up-012653951.html).

With AI set to dominate the tech landscape for the foreseeable future, Nvidia’s chips will only become more important to the industry. But rivals like [AMD are gaining steam](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-debuts-latest-ai-chips-as-it-battles-rivals-nvidia-intel-180032426.html), and Nvidia’s own customers are building chips of their own to reduce their dependence on the graphics card giant.

How that plays out over the next few years is anyone’s guess.

In today’s fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings report, Nvidia beat analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines on the strength of sales of its high-powered AI chips.

💵 Revenue: $35.08B vs  $33.2B expected  
💲 Adjusted EPS: $0.81 vs $0.74 expected  
💾 Data center revenue: $30.8B vs $29B expected

Nvidia also said it anticipates revenue of $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%, for the fiscal fourth quarter. That's just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37 billion.

I’ll be back tomorrow, Nov. 21, at 10 a.m. ET to answer your questions about Nvidia’s latest earnings, the market reaction, and where the stock goes from here.

"Doubt about [The Intelligent Investor]: Could this be an error?
","Chapter 2: The Investor and Inflation

\- Inflation and corporate earnings. (p. 51-52)

....""Our extended studies have led to the conclusion that the investor cannot count on much above the recent five-year rate earned on the DJIA group— about 10% on net tangible assets (book value) behind the shares. Since the market value of these issues is well above their book value—say, 900 market vs. 560 book in mid-1971—the earnings on current market price work out only at some 61⁄4%. (This relationship is generally expressed in the reverse, or “times earnings,” manner—e.g., that the DJIA price of 900 equals 18 times the actual earnings for the 12 months ended June 1971.)...""

It states that the market value of the stocks was 900, with an earnings yield of 6.25% (EPS = 56.25). Later, it mentions that this corresponds to a P/E ratio of 18 (""the DJIA price of 900 is equal to 18 times the actual earnings"").

However, when I calculate the P/E ratio, I get 16:

\\\[

\\text{P/E} = \\frac{\\text{Market Price}}{\\text{EPS}} = \\frac{900}{56.25} = 16

\\\]

So, I’m wondering:

1. Could the stated \*\*18\*\* in the book be an approximation or a rounded figure?
2. Or is there some other context or implicit calculation that justifies the value of 18?

Results after Investing for three months so far. ,"How am I doing so far? Any criticism or advice will greatly be appreciated! 

I’m looking to buy some growth and extra dividends!
Pharma, more AI stocks, Semiconductors, beauty products, bevs, SCMI on watchlist, and Nike stocks. 

I’m also a holder of SCHD, VOO, SCHG, SCHX, MSTY, CONY, SPYI, JEPQ, CVX, CVS, VICI, and Palantir are my majority holdings! 

Portfolio: 60-80% dividend stocks and 20-40% growth stocks.

My strategy is to sell high on my growth stocks and then reinvested into my dividends stocks. New funds going in monthly or biweekly will be out into stocks that are low and buy now! Then rinse, wash, and repeat. Is there anything I should be concerned about? 

After I get done paying off my student loans. All of those extra income will be going towards my savings and more funding! Any recommendations for 2025 will be appreciated!

How to Hedge Against Inflation: Thoughts on the Incoming Administration,"I’ve been thinking a lot about the incoming administration’s potential impact on inflation and the economy. Many of Trump’s proposed policies strike me as inherently inflationary. Here are some key points I’ve been considering:

1. **Mass Deportation:**
   * Disrupting this workforce will almost certainly induce inflation by increasing labor shortages and raising wages in certain sectors.
2. **Tariffs:**
   * Tariffs are another concern. Even if Trump walks back some of his campaign promises, tariffs are still inflationary.
3. **Cutting Government Jobs/Spending:**
   * This is sure to create economic strain.

**The Big Question:** Given these potential policies, where should I position myself in an inflationary environment???

* **Equities:**
   * Equities are often considered a hedge against inflation because companies can pass costs on to consumers. Housing also tends to be a good hedge, as property values often keep pace with inflation. However, at what point does sustained inflation trigger an **economic crash** or a sharp market sell-off?
* **Cash:**
   * Cash seems like a losing proposition during inflationary times, as its purchasing power erodes. But could there be a moment when the market correction makes holding cash advantageous? Warren Buffet seems to think so.
* **Tech Stocks:**
   * Imo tech stocks, particularly B2B companies, might be less impacted by these inflationary pressures. They’re less reliant on cheap labor and less vulnerable to tariffs. If there’s a broad market sell-off, I’d expect the S&P to take a hit initially, but I think tech might see breakouts later as inflationary impacts stabilize.

So, what do you all think? Where would you position yourself? Are there other sectors or strategies I’m overlooking?

Which high growth stock went higher than previous day high?,"These are high quality growth stocks that's trading higher than 13 weeks ago and higher than 52 weeks ago and have growth rate greater than 10% AND these had higher close today than previous trading day. It shows strong momentum to the upside but still we have to do our due diligence before opening new positions. My indicators on chart are as follows: Green cloud is 200 sma, Brown cloud is 50ema and the other two moving averages I have are 9/21 ema. If the price is above all the moving averages, that shows strong momentum to the up. On the bottom I have EPS (Earnings Per Share) and GPE - Price/Earnings to Growth which is also called PEG ratio. A lower PEG ratio indicates the stock is *undervalued.* An undervalued stock with high EPS ratio is good for long term hold.

Average market top is 101 days after un-inversion. We are at 78 days!

What are some interesting industries and market patterns coming up soon?,"Hello All!

I'm starting out trying to learn about individual stocks and how different industries act in the market. I have a 6 months worth of emergency savings. All of my retirement savings are in a pension fund and a deferred compensation plan that is run by my employer. My savings for a house is all in treasuries, so I am looking into individual stocks out of pure curiosity. I want to stress that I'm not looking to get rich or anything like that, I'm just wanting to learn.

Currently I have purchased stocks in the Financial, Defense, and Nuclear sectors and they have done quite well in the past few months. I learned that September, October, and November are particularly volatile months, but most of my stocks did pretty well and exceeded my expectations (I thought they would have all lost market value in this timeframe).

"Waymo opens robotaxi service to anyone in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet","Waymo, Alphabet’s autonomous vehicle subsidiary, has expanded its robotaxi service across nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles, marking its largest rollout yet. Starting Tuesday, Angelenos can use the Waymo One app to hail a self-driving taxi throughout the city, a significant step after over 300,000 residents joined the waitlist. This expansion makes LA the third major city with Waymo's robotaxi service, following Phoenix and San Francisco.

The company’s rapid growth has been fueled by a recent $5.6 billion funding round, led by Alphabet with contributions from Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, and others.

Stock market data help,"Hi everybody. I'm an economics student, and I'm currently writing my thesis on the effects of the U.S.-China trade war on the South Korean semiconductor industry. To make this analysis, I will look at the stock price fluctuations of SK semiconductor companies after certain tariff announcements. 

When I started working on my thesis in summer, I was able to download the historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance, and I have done so for many companies. Now that I'm working on my thesis again (deadline is in December) I want to add more companies to my list so I can make a generalizable analysis, however downloading the historical data on Yahoo is now behind a paywall so I will have to get the data elsewhere...

Does anyone know where I can **download historical data as a csv file**, preferably for free, or at least not as expensive as the $50/month Gold membership required to download from Yahoo? I would need data spanning multiple years.

I've come across some trading websites, but a lot of them only allow downloads for a year worth of data. As I said I'm willing to pay but it's hard for me to distinguish between these websites and know which ones are trustworthy as I'm not a part of the stock market / trading community.

Netflix ad-supported tier has 70 million monthly users two years after launch,"Netflix's ad-supported tier has gained significant traction, reaching 70 million monthly users globally two years after its launch in November 2022. The tier, introduced as a response to slowing subscriber growth, has become a popular choice, with over 50% of new sign-ups opting for the ad-supported plan in countries where it's available. Netflix credits this tier with helping boost membership numbers, reporting 282.7 million total subscribers across all pricing options last quarter.

The company is also seeing success with its advertising inventory, having sold out for two live NFL games on Christmas Day, a result of its three-year deal with the NFL. Advertisers like FanDuel, which will be the exclusive pregame sportsbook partner, and Verizon are lined up for the games. Netflix’s focus on ad-supported growth aligns with a broader industry shift towards affordable, ad-driven streaming options, as media companies seek new revenue streams in an increasingly competitive landscape. Starting next year, Netflix plans to pivot its performance reporting from subscriber numbers to revenue and other financial metrics, signaling a new phase in its growth strategy.

This law used to mean that model performance would continue to increase with data and computation, but the scaling effect has now plateaued.

Computing in the reasoning phase: To overcome pre-training bottlenecks, OpenAI and other labs are exploring “compute on test” techniques that enable human-like multi-step reasoning by allowing models to generate and evaluate multiple possibilities in real-time during the reasoning phase. This approach can be used more effectively for complex tasks such as mathematics and coding to optimize reasoning performance.

Hardware Demand Shift: Market demand is likely to shift from large-scale pre-training clusters to inference clouds as new technologies reduce parameter requirements. This will weaken NVIDIA's monopoly in the training chip market, and the inference chip market may see more competition, especially as companies such as Groq may fill the new demand.

So what if you worked in some capacity for the U.S. federal government and if done correctly you could dump shares and make billions of dollars liquid and pay 0% or as low of a tax as possible. 
Does this seem logical or am I missing something.

"Best ""turnaround"" stories in the market
","There are a few turnaround stories that appear to be going according to plan (Starbucks, $SBUX) and a few that aren't (Boeing, $BA). Whatever your view may be on a company, what are some companies/stocks that are currently in ""turnaround"" mode? Whether that be new leadership, updated product lines, or fresh culture.

I find it interesting to study, track, and ultimately research these companies to find things that work(ed). For example, I have kept up with the never-ending Boeing ($BA) saga of consistently defective quality. But the one thing that BA has going for it is that America *needs* Boeing, and given there's a duopoly of planes in the world (Boeing and Airbus), America is evermore invested and interested in Boeing survival.

Would love some additional companies to add to my radar in 'rebuilding' or 'turnaround' mode.",1,10,"There are a few turnaround stories that appear to be going according to plan Starbucks SBUX and a few that arent Boeing BA Whatever your view may be on a company what are some companiesstocks that are currently in turnaround mode Whether that be new leadership updated product lines or fresh culture

Give your opinion on my DCF analysis on different companies,"I've done a Google Sheets table where I do valuation on different companies so that I am able to get to the intrinsic value. I use the TTM Free Cash Flow and project its growth. The assumptions required are Free Cash Flow growth for 2024-2032, discount rate which takes into account time value of money and risk, perpetual growth which means FCF growth after 2032 and lastly I get the intrinsic value. I'll show my table with it's assumptions so you can tell me whether they should realistic or I should adjust some variable to be more realistic. I understand that these assumptions are optimistic but I am also optimistic about the companies so the numbers make sense to me. Discount rate is always 7.75% and Perpetual 3% so I'll just show my assumptions on FCF Growth for 2024-2032 and Intrinsic Value/DCF Price and the current price.

Last week's high volume stocks,"* **TSLA -** Tesla saw massive move to the up and it has now gone in over extended territory. Do not chase and wait for it to dip to support level at 271.28, 
* **BAC** \- Crossed over resistance of 44.26 and retested that level. It should keep going higher under lower interest rate environment. My immediate target (resistance) is at 47.24
* **MSFT** \- Good stock to go/stay longs. Unlike many other stocks that's hitting ATH, MSFT still hasn't flown away to hit the ATH. It's not the question IF, the question is WHEN. Immediate resistance is at 438/439.
* **UPST** \- Upstart had great earnings and the stock went up by 24% in a day after earnings. The next immediate resistance is sitting between 86-95
* **META** \- Meta is going in a range at this point. The support is sitting at 558-569 and price coming to that area will be nicely bought.
* **INTC** \- Intel had nice weekly bullish candle. There are few pivot (support) levels: 24.71, 23.56, 22.12. My immediate target is at 27.86 where it can face some resistance.
* **AAPL** \- Apple has been going in a range. We need to look for a breakout/down. A close below 213 is a breakdown whereas close above 238 in daily chart will be a breakout.
* **AMZN** \- Amazon had a breakout above 200. Will it retest or continue going higher? My target to above sits at 214 for now.
* **AMD** \- Lot of people are looking at AMD. It had a bullish last week but I believe it still has some more room below before rallying.
* **SOFI** \- Nice weekly breakout. Do not chase and wait for retest. The key level to retest is at 11/12 range.

I'm extremely bullish on TSLA. ,"I just had hand surgery so I'm writing this one-handed, but during my recovery I did nothing but look at TSLA charts. I've never been a big believer of technical analysis and I know some people ride and die for support levels but honestly I find it can be quite distracting and not very useful. In this case, however, we can notice a pattern of bag holders who have FOMO'd into something they've wanted to sell for a quick buck and then had to bear the pain sometimes for years. A good deal of those sold at a loss at some point but TSLA's Market Cap is still made up in some part of people in the red. These people have been waiting to cash in for years and at this point they're not gonna sell unless it at least hits a historic high. So I do believe that a price of $400 is, at least for now, an important support level for this stock, and if I know the dude-bro culture that is largely responsible of this rally, I'd actually say $420 is an ever more reasonable price within the next 2 months.

"Passive Investing: Benefits, Challenges, and the Hybrid Approach","This is a long one, so I made interim summaries to keep the main points clear.

I'm working on a quant model aimed at outperforming the SPY at similar risk levels. The motivation behind this is the challenge of choosing the right passive products and the fact that most managed portfolios have underperformed the SPY.

Would love to hear your thoughts on the hybrid model I’m working on or any experience you’ve had with quant models.

Thanks!

**So, let's start...**  
  
The meteoric rise in popularity of the passive investment approach is overall a positive trend for retail investors. However, there’s one critical point I’d like to emphasize—there’s no such thing as truly passive investing. At least, not in an absolute sense. So, after dropping that bombshell, let me dive into the details.

# Passive Investing

The passive investment approach is based on studies showing that the chances of outperforming the benchmark or market return through active portfolio management are notably low. Yes, some fund managers manage to beat the index, and they often make headlines. But studies reveal that a manager who has beaten their chosen benchmark doesn’t necessarily keep outperforming it consistently.

So, a manager might have a good year, or even a few. But in the long run—this is the key point—it just doesn’t work. Another aspect of these studies is that even if a skilled manager can beat the benchmark, the likelihood of investors finding and choosing that manager among all others is, in itself, quite low.

**Interim Summary:** *Fund managers don’t consistently beat the index, and investors don’t consistently pick the managers who do.*

# Passive Investment Products

The widespread success and understanding of passive investing benefits are visible in the huge range of passive investment products. This vast supply reflects high demand but also creates complexity, which I’ll highlight further.

Passive products, like index-tracking ETFs, are diversified, have low management fees, and enable investors to follow indexes or groups of stocks based on common themes like blockchain, electric vehicles, robotics, cannabis, and more.

As of August 2024, nearly 3,500 ETFs trade on Wall Street, most of them passively managed. Their numbers grow at an impressive double-digit rate year-over-year. But as I previously mentioned, this impressive supply adds complexity, effectively introducing active elements into the passive approach.

# The Small and Medium problems of Passive Investing

While studies highlight the effectiveness of the passive approach, it’s particularly efficient over the long term, with research recommending at least a 15-year period. Here’s why:

* In 2008, the S&P 500 fell by 50% during the subprime crisis.
* In 2018, the S&P dropped 20% between September and October.
* At the start of 2020, amid the COVID-19 outbreak, the S&P lost 34% in just a few weeks.
* In 2022, the S&P completed a 27% decline from its peak.

**Don’t get me wrong—I’m a proponent of passive investing**. But it’s crucial to grasp this long-term factor. Index investing is risky, even over the long term. The risk remains constant year after year, but the ability to recover from declines is the game-changer in passive investing—the long-term horizon is essential.

**Interim Summary:** *Passive investments are effective over the long term, yet most investors struggle to commit to this time frame, and in any case, the choices of tracked index and tracking product are active decisions.*

# Macro and Micro Risks

Investment risks can be simplified into two categories—macro and micro risks. Looking at passive investing through a risk lens can clarify why it’s so efficient. Essentially, with passive products (index-tracking investments), we neutralize micro risks, as broad diversification protects us from risks associated with specific companies.

Conversely, macro risks persist even in passive investments. Passive investing counters macro risks by relying on the investment horizon—the longer the time frame, the greater the ability to recover from downturns.

**Interim Summary:** *Passive investing uniquely addresses both micro and macro risks. In contrast, active investing is exposed to both types of risks and tries to mitigate them through research and forecasting. As we’ve seen, most managers fail to manage these risks effectively and lag behind the indexes over time.*

# The Hybrid Investment Approach – Something Different

Taking a middle path, Hybrid Invest uses passive instruments exclusively, neutralizing micro risks like passive investing. Here, hybrid management comes into play, combining active and passive approaches.

In a nutshell, the hybrid investment approach focuses solely on macro risk analysis, using a fixed formula or quantitative model that is unaffected by investor psychology. The result is a portfolio aligned with macroeconomic trends. The implementation remains passive—the portfolio consists of highly liquid, central ETFs. Unlike the active approach, it disregards the microeconomic environment, focusing on index-tracking products.

**Let's revisit the large and small asterisks of passive investing. It’s clear that the hybrid approach addresses both in two ways: (1) adaptation to the macroeconomic environment reduces reliance on the investment horizon, and (2) it offers an active element in selecting the index-tracking product at the core of the passive approach.**

For example, I am 30 and when I try to talk to my friends about investing or getting them to invest it always goes in one ear and out the other or they think there is no point. These same people will complain about the economy and gas/grocery prices etc. and when you try to tell them thats the whole point of why you need to be investing they just don’t believe it or think it only benefits “rich” people. Now i get it home prices are insane and a real problem, but had I not started investing from 2019 instead of saying “there is no point” and just complained the whole time I would not have the 20k extra from the market gains apart from my contributions I made in my non retirement account from 2019 up until now. I literally used to doordash for three years with my Honda civic and only made about 20-25k net doing that eventually got a low level call center role at a brokerage firm where i was able to increase investing even more and am in a lot better place financially because of it, hell it has even helped my lifelong depression.

Money DOES NOT cure depression or make us happy, but it has made it a little better as I have been diagnosed with major depression since a child. And honestly just like eating more healthy investing has helped in a way as anyone who deals with depression knows there is no cure really but I have found investing has helped me a lot not only by providing more stability but as a way to distract my mind and read about it etc. 

Anyways, I say all of this to just see has anyone else’s experience been similar to where you see people struggling etc and maybe they don’t have ideal jobs, but they still choose to complain or blame politics for their suffering?

Even if its only 20 dollars a week 20 dollars a week compounded is still better than 0 5-10 years down the road.

Tips for beginners ,"Good evening everyone, I'll be brief here

I'm from Brazil and with the announcement of the election results in the US, our currency has depreciated more than it already was

In the coming years I will seek to protect my assets from Brazilian fiscal irresponsibility by buying and investing in dollars (even if it is a little costly for me because of the exchange rate)

I have an account with a Brazilian investment brokerage that allows me to access the American market and stock exchange and if I don't do it now, in about 2 years, it will be very difficult economically for us

In Brazil, I work in a restaurant and I manage to save money each month, which I use to invest in the Brazilian stock market and buy dollars at the same time (I don't only have my work as a source of income)

RIVN and other EV makers: How will Trump-Musk dynamics affect the market?,"We all know Musk and Trump have a ""special relationship,"" and with Trump returning to office, I can't help but wonder how this might affect other EV manufacturers, especially Rivian.

On the positive side, Volkswagen's investment in RIVN seems solid, and it looks like exactly the kind of European business involvement Trump wants to see in the US market. But here's what's bugging me - could Musk's influence on Trump's policies create an uneven playing field for emerging EV brands?

Some points to consider:
- Rivian's growing production numbers and improving margins
- VW's commitment to the US market through RIVN
- Tesla's dominant position and Musk's political connections
- Potential policy changes affecting EV subsidies

"Trump Election, How to Play","Stocks to be bullish on during a Trump term:

Oil: $XOP, $XOM, $SHEL, $MRO

C*****: $COIN, $MARA, $WULF

Big Bois - Apple: $MSFT, $NVDA, $AMZN etc

Military: $BA, $LMT, $RTX

Prison: CoreCivic ($CXW)

Sectors to be bearish on during a Trump term:

All renewable energy (except maybe nuclear)

Agriculture: immigrants make up significant amount of (cheap) labor for the sector

International shipping: tariffs and isolationist policy would be bad

Auto-manufacturing: parts coming from overseas will have tariffs

Low cost foreign retail like Shein and Temu equivalents will get hit hard by tariffs

⚠️Increased Volatility: Awaiting Action⚠️

Cannabis: Republicans have historically been tough on marijuana. It seemed like things would be par for the course once again until Trump said on Truth Social that he would be voting in favor of Amendment 3 in Florida which would make it completely legal for adults 21 and up. I suspect this was a grift, but he’s such a wildcard that maybe he really would go against the conservative grain.

$APPL: While I left it out of the Big Bois due to the China taxes being a bearish variable, I think it should still hold strong in the long term.  We’ll see

$TSM probably has the widest range of outcomes in the market imo. 
If Trump’s attitude toward China is legit-

Best Pro: $TSM sees increased demand from U.S. and allies who want to bypass China’s questionable supply chain.

Worst Con: $TSM still makes most of their money from China, who could retaliate in a number of ways

Least worst con: $TSM is still intertwined with China’s cheaper supply chain. A western supply chain would be more expensive and be time consuming to adopt.

Don’t even want to consider it possible, but anything less diplomatic than economic warfare with China would be drastic not only for $TSM but for the people of Taiwan, god forbid.

$DJT + $TSLA: boy oh boy🤢
Ironically, both of these companies are suffering from the same problem and are presenting the same solution.

Solution: present people with a charismatic rich guy in hopes they will buy/use the product off of pure Ethos alone.

APPL While I left it out of the Big Bois due to the China taxes being a bearish variable I think it should still hold strong in the long term  Well see

TSM probably has the widest range of outcomes in the market imo 
If Trumps attitude toward China is legit

Best Pro TSM sees increased demand from US and allies who want to bypass Chinas questionable supply chain

Worst Con TSM still makes most of their money from China who could retaliate in a number of ways

Least worst con TSM is still intertwined with Chinas cheaper supply chain A western supply chain would be more expensive and be time consuming to adopt

Dont even want to consider it possible but anything less diplomatic than economic warfare with China would be drastic not only for TSM but for the people of Taiwan god forbid

DJT  TSLA boy oh boy
Ironically both of these companies are suffering from the same problem and are presenting the same solution

Problem half decent product lacking a reliable consumer base

Solution present people with a charismatic rich guy in hopes they will buyuse the product off of pure Ethos alone 

Neither of these share prices move on fundamentals but there will come a day when the market finally recognizes them as a social media app and car company respectively I imagine it wont be pretty if their fundamentals arent fixed by then",-0.013186177248677253,neutral,0,0

+$1000 in My Portfolio Thanks to TSLA's 12% Jump – Other Sectors Hit Hard,"Got some nice news today when I checked my investment tracker—up $1,000!

\#TSLA is definitely carrying the returns even though it's only 5% of my portfolio.

Being the single largest donor to Trump's campaign is working out for Elon (and me).

What surprised me, though, is seeing other stocks like Coca-Cola (KO) and some REITs reacting negatively, dropping by about -4%. It makes me wonder why certain sectors seem to be moving in the opposite direction. 

It looks like today’s heatmap is showing a clear trend: sectors like consumer non-durables and health tech took a noticeable hit, while finance and tech stocks are up. Interesting to see how varied the reactions are across sectors—maybe it’s tied to post-election sentiments or a shift in investor focus? Anyone else noticing similar patterns in their portfolio?

"Why do justified sudden drops in a share price matter, if you were only holding for dividends anyway?","I have never really understood how shares work fully in terms of company investment, especially when it comes to a share price suddenly falling, even if dodgy. (E.g. exaggerated profit during recent quarter.)

For example, let's say I create the company Tesco and eventually I go public on the stockmarket and then I keep 51% of shares, but the rest go on the stock market at £10 a share. The total number of shares at 100% is 1,000,000. 40% of the 49% are bought immediately and around 9% remains unsold at all times.

Now, as the company owner I get £4,000,000 private cash (assume no fees) and then retain 51% of all future profits. I pocket the cash and don't invest any of this into the company as it already has it's own healthy cash flow.

Anyway, let's say in 3 months time the profit is overstated (Like Tesco did in 2014) and the share price drops from £10 per share to £8. The same strangers that own the 40% of shares will still get the actual profit (from dividends) they would have got anyway, as the share price doesn't affect profit earned. Sure, their ROI on the actual share itself is affected, but only if they sell the share at the reduced price.


...if you don't sell and didn't plan on selling, then you are unaffected, no?

Clearly I am wrong though, as Tesco was heavily fined billions for something like this.

Merck: Large Value Company Currently Undervalued,"# My Investment Thesis:

A strong lineup of important drugs and vaccines, including Keytruda for cancer and Gardasil for HPV prevention. Merck’s strengths come from its solid patents, high spending on research, and valuable partnerships. Reliable income, supported by demand in both human and animal health, gives it a steady cash flow, which is used to grow and reward shareholders.

The company is focused on leading areas like cancer and immunotherapy, which keeps it aligned with current trends in healthcare. Keytruda, its top drug, is now approved for over 40 types of cancer in the U.S., showing its strong position in this market. The company’s future looks promising, with new drugs in late-stage trials and partnerships with firms like Moderna and Daiichi Sankyo to develop new treatments. Although challenges like pricing rules and patent losses are expected, Merck’s focus on early-stage treatments and personalized medicine shows it is planning for long-term steady growth.

The stock is trading at just 10.70 times its forward earnings and mostly below its 5-year averages. High Earnings Yield. Based on my Fair Price estimate, is undervalued by more than 30%. Other analysts are also positive-looking. If you are looking for a stable healthcare investment with steady growth potential, worth noting.

# My Fair Price Estimate:

[Author's Fair Price Estimate](https://preview.redd.it/ed5tovujx1zd1.png?width=1774&format=png&auto=webp&s=39249c2b0404a8dd3b50fc73ae8711560c6faa27)

I used:

* Discount Rate: 12% *(S&P 500 Next 5-Yr Growth Estimates is 11.04%)*
* Margin of Safety: 30%
* Years: 5
* Future EPS Growth Rate: 7% *(I will explain below)*
* Future Dividend and Buyback Yield: 3% *(I will explain below)*
* Total Future Annual Growth Rate: 7 + 3 = 10%

The expected YoY EPS growth for FY 2024 is projected to be significantly higher (see the image below) compared to FY 2023, but it is anticipated to stabilize in the following years. As mentioned in the Future section, the global pharmaceutical market is projected to have a CAGR of 7.7% through 2030. Initially, I set this figure at 8%, but I revised it to 7% due to Merck being a large value stock with potential future challenges, which we discussed in the Disadvantages section. Therefore, I believe 7% is a reasonable estimate for our analysis.

The average buyback and dividend yield is 3.46%, but for Merck, I decided to lower this figure to 3%. The reason is similar: Merck is a large-cap stock that may face potential issues in the future and increased competition. Consequently, I aimed for a final total future growth rate of 10% 😉

For the Bull Case, I used a future exit P/E of 24, which is based on the company's five-year average. In the Bear Case, I selected the lowest P/E ratio from the last few years, which was 18. For the Base Case, I took the midpoint between the Bull and Bear Cases, resulting in a value of 21. Notably, 21 is also their current P/E ratio.

Why Donald Trump’s Return Could Boost Demand for Robots – A Long-Term Investment Opportunity,"Hey everyone,

With Donald Trump making a return, I think there’s more to consider than just the political drama. Specifically, his policies could have a huge ripple effect on the labor market, especially in the service industry. Trump’s stance on illegal immigration means we could see a stronger push to reduce undocumented workers, which would lead to an even bigger labor shortage in industries like hospitality, food service, and logistics. If fewer workers are available, companies will likely have to fill that gap—and robots could be the answer.

That’s where robotics companies come in, especially ones like Tesla, Richtech Robotics (RR), and Serve Robotics. Tesla is aiming to make waves with its humanoid robots, while Serve Robotics focuses on last-mile delivery solutions in urban areas. But let’s talk about Richtech Robotics (RR) in particular because they’ve already got robots deployed and working in real-world environments, addressing exactly the kind of labor shortages we’re talking about. RR’s service robots are already in use across various industries, from restaurants to healthcare facilities, and they’re receiving high praise from clients for their reliability and efficiency. Their tech isn’t just conceptual—it’s been tested and proven, which gives them a solid foothold as demand grows.

And then there’s Elon Musk himself. If he ends up being involved in government restructuring, it wouldn’t be surprising to see him push for more automation within federal jobs too, given his passion for robotics and AI. If Musk advocates for more robots in both private and public sectors, we could see a huge surge in the robotics industry overall.

Sure, the attention is still on DJT stocks and virtual currency as short-term plays riding the Trump wave, but I see robotics as a sector with way more potential for sustainable growth. For those of us looking for long-term positions, robots could be the steady play we’re after, especially as the tech gets better and companies like RR, SERV continue proving their value in real-world applications.

Anyone else seeing this as a big moment to get into robotics stocks for the long haul?",0,9,"Hey everyone

Hindenburg Short Report on PACS,"Link: [https://hindenburgresearch.com/pacs/](https://hindenburgresearch.com/pacs/)

**Summary:**

* PACS Group allegedly exploited COVID-era waivers to inflate Medicare revenue by claiming skilled care needs for COVID-exposed patients, significantly boosting profitability.
* Hindenburg's investigation reveals PACS generated over 100% of its 2020-2023 operating income from these schemes, enabling a lucrative IPO in 2024.
* Former employees allege PACS engaged in aggressive billing tactics, including Medicare Part B claims for unnecessary respiratory and sensory therapies.
* PACS purportedly misrepresented facility quality metrics to mislead shareholders, with only 29% of its facilities meeting high CMS ratings.
* The investigation details further regulatory evasion, including ""renting"" administrator licenses to operate multiple facilities beyond legal limits.

Stock currently down 37%.

**Quick dissection of the chart-** $35 is the short if you aren't fast enough to get first prints, because we make new lows. Note the lower lows- we have $40 as that initial ""lower high"", then $38, then we pretty much give up at $35 and everyone panics out. Losing some in attempt to short \~$36.50 is acceptable IMO.
